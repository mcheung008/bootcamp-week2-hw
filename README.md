# bootcamp-week2-hw

I created my portfolio page with links to other pages including a page titled "about me" and "contact."

Using the "bootstrap" framework the portfolio I created is responsive to whatever device is used to view the content.

I created a nav bar that adjusts to screen size and will become a drop down menu if the screen has reached a minimum size.

On my main portfolio page I included images of previous work I have done with buttons below the pictures to take the user to a more detailed explanation of the work.

On the "about me" page I shared a little about myself including my education background and my interests.

On my contacts page a potential client can fill out their name, email, and any commments or questions they may have for me.

My portfolio page also has my name on the upper right-hand corner that is also a link that will take the user to the "about me" section.

I also included a button titled "lets meet" on my portfolio page which takes the user directly to the "contact" page.

I included a footer at the bottom of all my pages

All navbars and footers should be consistent on all pages.
